# Customized tmux

Open `tmux.sh` to see the current configuration. You could either use it as a boilerplate or open your `~/.tmux.conf` and copy that content.  

## How to
- Create a new file, `myawesometmuxfile.sh`
- Make it runnable: `chmod +x myawesometmuxfile.sh`.
- Run the file: `./myawesometmuxfile.sh`.

Depending on your configuration tmux will create a new session and/or attach to it from a new tmux window. (see the last line in `tmux.sh` in this repo).

## Add to project
You can now include your `myawesometmuxfile.sh` in your repo. By doing so all your teammates, amigos or enemies can have the same tmux-config while working on the project.
